# Robustness Calculator
This is a prototype implementation for the work *A Behavioral Notion of Robustness for Software Systems* which will appear in FSE 2020. We propose a behavioral notion of software robustness based on labelled transition systems (LTS).

This program takes a system specification *S*, an environment specification *E*, and a safety property *P*, and computes the robustness of the system against the environment *E* and property *P*. This program can also compare the robustness between two designs of a system or the robustness of a system under two properties.

By default, all the specifications should be specified in FSP, the modelling language used by [the LTSA tool](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/ltsa/). In addition, the program accepts environment models defined in the Enhanced Operator Function Model ([EOFM](http://fhsl.eng.buffalo.edu/EOFM/)), which is a specification language for modeling human tasks.

## System Requirements
This program requires Java version >= 1.8. The program has been tested under
```

generate explanations for the system robustness. In addition, it can compare the
robustness of two systems or a system under different properties.

In ```verbose``` mode, the program will also print the explanation for each representation trace, e.g.,
```
$ java -jar robustness-calculator.jar --compute models/abp/perfect_channel.json -v

...

Generating explanations for the representation traces...
Matching the Representative Trace No.0 '[send[1], rec[0]]' to the deviation model...

Use the ```-o``` option can save the representation traces into a JSON file, e.g.,
```
java -jar robustness-calculator.jar --compute -o models/abp/perfect_result.json models/abp/perfect_channel.json
```

The resulting JSON file looks like:
```
{
  "mode" : "compute",
  "traces" : [ {
    "trace" : "send[1], rec[0]",
    "explanation" : "input, send[1], trans.corrupt, rec[0]"

    "explanation" : "input, send[1], rec[1], output, ack[0], ack.corrupt, getack[1]"
  }, {

  } ]
}
```

### Radiation Therapy System (Section 7.3)
#### Compare Robustness of two designs (Section 7.3.4)
```
$ java -jar robustness-calculator.jar --compare models/therac25/therac_robust.json models/therac25/therac.json

...

Representation Trace No.2: [hPressX, hPressUp, hPressE, hPressEnter, hPressB]
```

The program generates three representation traces indicating that the new design is more robust than the old design.

#### Compare Robustness Under Two Properties (Section 7.3.5)
```
$ java -jar robustness-calculator.jar --compare models/therac25/therac.json models/therac25/therac_strong_p.json

...

Generating the representation traces by equivalence classes...
Number of equivalence classes: 1
Representation Trace No.0: [hPressE, hPressUp, hPressX, hPressEnter, hPressB]
```

The program generates one representation trace indicating that the system is considered to be less robust under the stronger property.

## System Description File
In the above examples, the program takes one or more system description files (JSON files) as inputs. This section describes how to define such description files.

A description file is a JSON file in the following format, (e.g., the description for the ABP protocol):
```
{
  "mode": "fsp",                    // should be either "fsp" or "eofm"
  "sys": "models/abp/abp.lts",      // the path to the system model specification
  "env": "models/abp/abp_env.lts",  // the path to the environment model specification
  "prop": "models/abp/p.lts",       // the path to the property model specification
  "deviation": "models/abp/abp_env_lossy.lts" // the path to the deviation model specification.
                                              // In the "eofm" mode, the deviation model is not required.
}
```

In the *eofm* mode, we need additional descriptions for translating a EOFM model to a LTSA model (e.g., the description for the radiation therapy system). However, the details of the translation process is not described in the paper due to the page limit):
```
{
  "mode": "eofm",                     // should be either "fsp" or "eofm"
  "sys": "models/therac25/sys.lts",   // the path to the system model specification
  "env": "models/therac25/therac25_nowait.xml", // the path to the environment model specification in EOFM (a XML file)
  "prop": "models/therac25/p_w.lts",  // the path to the property model specification
  "eofm": {                           // additional description for translating EOFM to LTSA
    "initialValues": {
      "iInterface": "Edit",
      ...
    },
    "world": [
      "when (iInterface == Edit) hPressX -> VAR[ConfirmXray][InPlace][iPowerLevel]",
      ...
    ],
    "relabels": {}
  }
}
```

## Compute Unsafe behaviors of the system
Use ```java -jar robustness-calculator.jar --unsafe FILE``` option can compute the unsafe behaviors of the system, i.e., the set of traces allowed by the system but will lead to a safety property violation.
```
java -jar robustness-calculator.jar --unsafe models/abp/perfect_channel.json
Environment LTS: 9 states and 24 transitions.
System LTS: 20 states and 67 transitions.
Number of equivalence classes: 8
Representation Trace No.0: [rec[0]]
Representation Trace No.1: [rec[1]]
Representation Trace No.2: [send[1], getack[0]]
Representation Trace No.3: [send[1], getack[1]]
Representation Trace No.4: [send[1], rec[1], getack[0]]
Representation Trace No.5: [send[1], rec[1], getack[1]]
Representation Trace No.6: [send[1], rec[1], ack[1], rec[0]]
Representation Trace No.7: [send[1], rec[1], ack[1], rec[1]]
```

For example, the trace ```rec[0]``` represents that when the system synchronize with this trace, it is *possible* for the system to enter the error state because of some internal actions which cannot be controlled by the environment.

## Assumptions on the [LTSA](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~jnm/book/) specifications
As a prototype implementation, the program carries the following assumptions:
- The system specification needs to be a process named *SYS*.
- The environment specification needs to be a process named *ENV*.
- The property specification needs to be a process named *P*.
- The constants defined in different specifications need to be distinct.
- The deviation environment specification needs to be a process named *ENV*.
- The deviation environment specification needs to define a menu named *ERR_ACTS* to indicate the error actions in the environment.
